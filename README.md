Problem statement:The primary objective of implementing the Hostel Food Reviewing System is to enhance the dining experience for hostel residents while simultaneously reducing food wastage



The Problem it Solves:
Where sustainability and responsible consumption are increasingly prioritized, the issue of food wastage has become a significant concern, particularly in institutional settings such as college hostels. At the same time, students often face the challenge of making informed choices about their meals within the constraints of limited food resources.
To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative Hostel Food Reviewing System.
